                Good morning everyone! Before we dive into new material, let's do a quick
                five-minute review of everything we covered yesterday. I want to make sure those
                numbers, classroom objects, and commands are really sticking with you because we're
                going to build on them today.

              <p style="margin-top: 10px">
                <strong>Part 1: Speed Counting</strong> - Alright, here's what we're going to do.
                We're all going to count together from 0 to 30 in French, and we're going to try to
                do it as fast as we can while still pronouncing everything correctly. Ready?
                Everyone together - <span class="french-phrase" lang="fr">Zéro!</span> Good!
                <span class="french-phrase" lang="fr">Un, deux, trois, quatre, cinq...</span> Keep

                different objects around our classroom, and I want you to shout out the French word
                if you know it. Don't worry about being wrong - just give it a try! Remember to
                include <span class="french-phrase" lang="fr">un</span> or
                <span class="french-phrase" lang="fr">une</span> before the noun. Ready? [Teacher

              </p>
              <p style="margin-top: 10px">
                Alright everyone, let's check in with our friend James! Remember him from the past
                few days? He found his apartment at
                <span class="french-phrase" lang="fr">numéro vingt-cinq, rue Mouffetard</span>, he's
                settled in with his roommate Pierre, and he's been practicing his greetings with
                <span class="french-phrase" lang="fr">tu</span> and
                <span class="french-phrase" lang="fr">vous</span>. Well, today is a big day for
                James - it's his first official day of classes at the Sorbonne!
              </p>
              <p style="margin-top: 10px">
                James is 22 years old - in French we say
                <span class="french-phrase" lang="fr">Il a vingt-deux ans</span> (He has 22 years).
                He's really excited but also a little nervous. Why? Well, think about it - he needs
                to navigate a huge university campus in a foreign country! He needs to find
                classroom numbers like <span class="french-phrase" lang="fr">Salle 47</span> (Room
                47) or <span class="french-phrase" lang="fr">Amphi 92</span> (Lecture Hall 92). He
                needs to understand his student ID number when someone asks for it. He needs to know
                which bus to take - the <span class="french-phrase" lang="fr">38</span>, the
                <span class="french-phrase" lang="fr">47</span>, or the
                <span class="french-phrase" lang="fr">96</span>? And when people give him phone
                numbers or addresses, they're using numbers way higher than what we've learned so
                far.
              </p>
              <p style="margin-top: 10px">
                So today, we're going to help James out by learning numbers from 31 all the way up
                to 100! This way, when his professor says "<span class="french-phrase" lang="fr"
                  >Ouvrez votre livre à la page soixante-quinze</span
                >" (Open your book to page 75), James will know exactly where to go. And when he
                needs to take bus number
                <span class="french-phrase" lang="fr">quatre-vingt-six</span> (86) to get back home,
                he'll be able to read the sign correctly. Let's make sure James has a successful
                first day at university!

              <h4>Teacher Lecture: The French Counting System</h4>
              <p>
                Alright everyone, now we're getting into the interesting part of French numbers! The
                pattern continues logically through the 30s, 40s, 50s, and 60s - you'll pick these
                up quickly. But then something fascinating happens at 70. The French counting system
                takes a unique turn that makes it different from most other languages.
              </p>

              <p style="margin-top: 10px">
                Let me explain: In standard French (what we call "French from France"), instead of
                having a word for 70, they say
                <span class="french-phrase" lang="fr">soixante-dix</span> which literally means
                "sixty-ten." So 71 is "sixty-eleven" (<span class="french-phrase" lang="fr"
                  >soixante-et-onze</span
                >), 72 is "sixty-twelve" (<span class="french-phrase" lang="fr">soixante-douze</span
                >), and so on up to 79 which is "sixty-nineteen" (<span
                  class="french-phrase"
                  lang="fr"
                  >soixante-dix-neuf</span
                >).
              </p>

              <p style="margin-top: 10px">
                Then at 80, instead of a single word, French uses
                <span class="french-phrase" lang="fr">quatre-vingts</span> - literally
                "four-twenties." This is a leftover from when people counted in groups of 20! So 81
                is "four-twenties-one" (<span class="french-phrase" lang="fr">quatre-vingt-un</span
                >), 82 is "four-twenties-two," and so on. And here's the final twist: 90 is
                <span class="french-phrase" lang="fr">quatre-vingt-dix</span> - "four-twenties-ten!"
                So 99, the highest two-digit number, is
                <span class="french-phrase" lang="fr">quatre-vingt-dix-neuf</span> -
                "four-twenties-ten-nine."
              </p>

              <p style="margin-top: 10px">
                Now, fun cultural note: In Belgium and Switzerland, they actually simplify this!
                They say <span class="french-phrase" lang="fr">septante</span> for 70,
                <span class="french-phrase" lang="fr">octante</span> or
                <span class="french-phrase" lang="fr">huitante</span> for 80, and
                <span class="french-phrase" lang="fr">nonante</span> for 90. Much more logical! But
                we'll learn the French system since that's what you'll encounter most often. Let's
                practice these step by step.

              <p>
                Let's learn the days of the week - you'll need these constantly for talking about
                your schedule, making plans, and understanding when things happen. Here's something
                interesting: in French, the days of the week are NOT capitalized unless they're at
                the beginning of a sentence. Also, notice that many French day names come from Latin
                and Roman gods, just like in English!

              <h4>Teacher Lecture: Getting to Know People</h4>
              <p>
                When you meet someone new in France, there are some essential questions you'll want
                to ask to have a real conversation beyond just "hello." We've already learned
                <span class="french-phrase" lang="fr">Comment tu t'appelles?</span> and
                <span class="french-phrase" lang="fr">Comment ça va?</span> - now let's add more
                questions so you can get to know someone properly. These questions are the
                foundation of every friendship and professional relationship you'll build in French!
              </p>

              <p style="margin-top: 10px">
                Now, here's something important about French conversation culture: French people
                often ask quite direct personal questions early in a conversation - questions that
                might feel a bit forward in American culture. Asking someone's age, where they live,
                what they study or do for work - these are all normal questions within the first few
                minutes of meeting someone! It's not considered rude; it's how French people
                establish common ground and figure out if they might have shared interests or
                connections.
              </p>

              <p style="margin-top: 10px">
                Remember from our tu/vous lesson that every single one of these questions has both
                an informal and formal version. When you're meeting another student your age, use
                <span class="french-phrase" lang="fr">tu</span>. When you're meeting a professor,
                your friend's parents, someone older, or anyone in a professional context, use
                <span class="french-phrase" lang="fr">vous</span>. The good news? The questions
                follow the same pattern - you just need to adjust the verb ending and the pronoun.
                Let's practice both versions so you're comfortable in any situation.
              </p>

              <p style="margin-top: 10px">
                One more tip: when someone asks you these questions, they genuinely want to know the
                answer! French conversation style values depth and engagement. Give real answers,
                not just one-word responses. If someone asks where you're from, you might add a
                sentence about what it's like there. If they ask what you study, explain why you
                chose that subject. This back-and-forth, this exchange of real information, is how
                French friendships begin.

                Alright everyone, now we're going to put all these question words together into real

                <strong>Partner Interview Activity:</strong> I want you to find a partner - someone

                take turns interviewing each other. One person asks all four questions first while
                the other person answers, then you switch roles. And here's the important part:
                write down what your partner says! At the end, I'm going to call on a few of you to
                introduce your partner to the class in French.

              <h4>Teacher Lecture: French Around the World</h4>
              <p>
                I want to share something exciting with you: when you learn French, you're not just
                learning to communicate with people in France. French is spoken by over 300 million
                people across five continents! It's an official language in 29 countries and is the
                second most studied language in the world after English. Let me show you the
                incredible diversity of the French-speaking world.
              </p>

              <p style="margin-top: 10px">
                In Europe, besides France, you have Belgium, Switzerland, Luxembourg, and Monaco. In
                North America, there's Quebec in Canada and parts of Louisiana in the United States,
                plus several Caribbean islands like Haiti, Martinique, and Guadeloupe. In Africa -
                this is huge - over 30 African countries speak French, including Senegal, Ivory
                Coast, Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Madagascar, and many more. In fact, Africa has
                more French speakers than Europe!
              </p>

              <p style="margin-top: 10px">
                Then you have French territories in the Pacific like French Polynesia and New
                Caledonia, and in South America there's French Guiana. Each place has its own
                accent, its own expressions, its own culture - but they all share this beautiful
                language. The French-speaking world is called
                <span class="french-phrase" lang="fr">la Francophonie</span>, and it's incredibly
                diverse and vibrant. Learning French opens doors to all these cultures!

              <h4>Why is French So Global?</h4>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 10px">
                French isn't just spoken in France! It's a truly global language spoken on five
                continents. Here's why French became so widespread:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>French colonial history (17th-20th centuries)</strong> - France and
                  Belgium established colonies across Africa, Southeast Asia, the Caribbean, and the
                  Pacific, bringing the French language to these regions. While colonialism ended,
                  French often remained as an official language.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>French as a diplomatic language</strong> - For centuries, French was
                  <em>the</em> language of international diplomacy. Even today, diplomatic documents
                  are often written in both English and French.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Official language of major organizations</strong> - French is an official
                  language of the United Nations, European Union, NATO, the Olympics, FIFA, and many
                  other international organizations. This means all official documents must be
                  available in French.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Growing importance in Africa</strong> - Here's something surprising:
                  Africa is now home to more French speakers than Europe! Countries like Democratic
                  Republic of Congo, Ivory Coast, and Cameroon have huge French-speaking
                  populations. By 2050, it's projected there will be over 700 million French
                  speakers, with most living in Africa. This makes French an increasingly important
                  language for business and development.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p style="margin-top: 10px">
                <strong>Fun fact:</strong> French is the only language besides English spoken on all
                five continents! Learning French opens doors to Europe, Africa, North America, Asia,
                and Oceania.

                        <p>Alright everyone, welcome to French 101! Before we dive into learning French together, I need to understand where each of you is starting from. So we're going to begin today with a short diagnostic test - and I want to emphasize right away that this is not graded. This isn't about passing or failing; it's simply a tool to help me assess your incoming knowledge of French so I can tailor our course to meet your needs. Some of you might have studied French before, others might be complete beginners, and that's perfectly fine. This test just helps me understand each student's starting point so we can all make the most progress together this semester.</p>

                        <p>Now that we've completed the diagnostic test, let me officially welcome you to French 101! I'm excited to be your guide on this journey into the French language and francophone culture. Over the next 16 weeks, we're going to meet five days a week for one hour each day - that's 80 contact hours total. This is an intensive course, which means we'll be moving at a steady pace, but I promise you'll see real progress quickly.</p>
                        
                        <p style="margin-top: 10px;">Our goal for this semester is to bring you to what's called the A2 level on the CEFR scale - that's the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages. At A2, you'll be able to communicate in simple, routine tasks, describe your background and immediate environment, and express your needs in basic terms. Many of you will be ready to take the DELF A2 exam by the end of this course if you choose to pursue that certification. Let me walk you through how we'll get there.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Course Goal:</strong> Reach A2 level on CEFR scale / DELF A2 preparation</li>

                        <h4>Teacher Lecture: Your First French Words</h4>
                        <p>Alright everyone, now comes the exciting part - we're going to start speaking French! Today we're focusing on the absolute essentials: how to greet someone, how to introduce yourself, and how to ask someone's name. These might seem like simple phrases, but they're the foundation of every conversation you'll ever have in French. Master these, and you'll be able to walk up to any French speaker in the world and start a conversation.</p>
                        
                        <p style="margin-top: 10px;">Let's start with greetings. The word <span class="french-phrase" lang="fr">Bonjour</span> is probably the most important word you'll learn today. It means "Hello" or "Good day," and you use it any time during daylight hours. In the evening, you switch to <span class="french-phrase" lang="fr">Bonsoir</span> - "Good evening." Notice the pattern? <span class="french-phrase" lang="fr">Bon</span> means "good," <span class="french-phrase" lang="fr">jour</span> means "day," and <span class="french-phrase" lang="fr">soir</span> means "evening." French builds words logically like this. Now <span class="french-phrase" lang="fr">Salut</span> is informal - use it with friends and people your own age, but never with professors or in professional settings. And when it's time to say goodbye, <span class="french-phrase" lang="fr">Au revoir</span> is your formal farewell - literally "until we see each other again."</p>
                        
                        <p style="margin-top: 10px;">For introductions, the phrase <span class="french-phrase" lang="fr">Je m'appelle</span> literally means "I call myself," but we translate it as "My name is." The beauty of French is that once you learn this pattern, you can introduce yourself anywhere. To ask someone's name, we have two versions: <span class="french-phrase" lang="fr">Comment tu t'appelles?</span> for informal situations and <span class="french-phrase" lang="fr">Comment vous appelez-vous?</span> for formal. Don't worry about the grammar right now - just focus on the sounds and get comfortable saying these phrases. We'll break down the grammar later. For now, let's practice!</p>

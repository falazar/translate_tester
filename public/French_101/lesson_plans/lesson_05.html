              <h4>The Art of French Greetings</h4>
              <p>
                We've learned the words for greetings this week -
                <span class="french-phrase" lang="fr">Bonjour, Salut, Bonsoir</span> - but how do
                French people actually greet each other? It's not just about what you say; it's also
                about the physical gesture that goes with it. And this can vary quite a bit
                depending on who you're greeting and where you are in France!
              </p>

              <p style="margin-top: 10px">
                Let me break down the three main greeting styles you'll encounter in France:

              <h4>
                1. The Handshake (<span class="french-phrase" lang="fr">La Poignée de main</span>)
              </h4>
              <p>
                <strong>When to use:</strong> Business settings, formal situations, meeting someone
                for the first time (especially if they're older or in a position of authority)
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>How to do it:</strong> One firm handshake (not too aggressive!), maintain
                eye contact, say <span class="french-phrase" lang="fr">Enchanté(e)</span> when
                meeting someone new
              </p>
              <p><strong>Cultural notes:</strong></p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  In professional settings, you should shake hands every morning when you arrive at
                  work - even with colleagues you saw yesterday!
                </li>
                <li>Same thing when leaving - shake hands again at the end of the day</li>
                <li>
                  This might feel formal to Americans, but it's standard professional courtesy in
                  France
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p style="margin-top: 10px">
                <strong>James's experience:</strong> When James meets his professors at the
                Sorbonne, he shakes their hands and says
                <span class="french-phrase" lang="fr">Bonjour, Professeur Moreau. Enchanté!</span>

              <h4>2. The Cheek Kiss (<span class="french-phrase" lang="fr">La Bise</span>)</h4>
              <p>
                <strong>When to use:</strong> Friends, family, informal settings, social situations
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>How to do it:</strong> Lean in, touch cheeks (or just get close without
                actually touching), make a kissing sound - but here's the tricky part: how many
                times?
              </p>
              <p><strong>Regional differences - this is where it gets interesting!</strong></p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Paris:</strong> Usually 2 kisses (right cheek first, then left)</li>
                <li><strong>Provence:</strong> Usually 2 kisses</li>
                <li><strong>Brittany:</strong> Can be 1, 2, or even 3!</li>
                <li><strong>Loire Valley:</strong> Sometimes 4 kisses!</li>
              </ul>
              <p style="margin-top: 10px">
                <strong>Pro tip:</strong> When you're unsure, just follow the other person's lead.
                They'll set the pace, and you just mirror what they do. Don't stress about it - even
                French people from different regions sometimes have to figure it out together!
              </p>
              <p style="margin-top: 10px"><strong>Important boundaries:</strong></p>
              <ul>
                <li>La bise is typically between people who know each other, not strangers</li>
                <li>
                  In professional/workplace settings, stick with handshakes unless your colleagues
                  initiate la bise
                </li>
                <li>If you're uncomfortable, a smile and a verbal greeting is always acceptable</li>
                <li>
                  Men typically shake hands with each other rather than doing la bise (unless
                  they're family or very close friends)
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p style="margin-top: 10px">
                <strong>James's experience:</strong> When James meets his roommate Pierre's friends
                Sophie and Marie at a café, they greet him with la bise:
                <span class="french-phrase" lang="fr">Salut James! Ça va?</span> He was nervous at
                first, but they guided him through it!
              </p>
            </div>

            <div class="content-block">
              <h4>3. The Wave or Verbal Greeting Only</h4>
              <p>
                <strong>When to use:</strong> Across a distance, in a hurry, casual acknowledgment,
                or when hands are full
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>How to do it:</strong> A simple
                <span class="french-phrase" lang="fr">Salut!</span> or
                <span class="french-phrase" lang="fr">Coucou!</span> with a wave
              </p>
              <p><strong>Cultural notes:</strong></p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Perfectly acceptable to just say
                  <span class="french-phrase" lang="fr">Bonjour!</span> when passing someone on the
                  street
                </li>
                <li>
                  <span class="french-phrase" lang="fr">Coucou</span> is a very informal, friendly
                  greeting - like "Hey!" in English
                </li>
                <li>
                  It's polite to acknowledge people you pass in smaller towns (less common in Paris)
                </li>
              </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="content-block">
              <h4>Important Cultural Context: Personal Space</h4>
              <p>
                You might notice that French people tend to stand closer during conversations than
                Americans do. This isn't considered invasive - it's just the normal conversational
                distance in French culture. If someone steps closer while talking to you, they're
                not being aggressive; they're just being French!
              </p>
              <p style="margin-top: 10px">
                Similarly, making eye contact during greetings is important. It's considered polite
                and shows you're genuinely acknowledging the person. Looking away or down might come
                across as rude or disinterested.

              <strong>Remember:</strong> These greeting customs might feel awkward at first,
              especially la bise! But they're an important part of French culture. When in doubt,
              follow the other person's lead, and don't worry too much about getting it "perfect."
              French people understand that foreigners are learning these customs, and they
              appreciate the effort!

              <p>
                Over the weekend, James will explore more of Paris with Pierre and his new friends.
                Next week, we'll follow James as he meets more people and learns to talk about his
                family. He'll show Pierre photos of his parents, siblings, and even his dog! This
                means we'll be learning lots of new vocabulary about family members and how to
                describe people.

              this week is to review a little bit each day rather than cramming Sunday night. Spend
              15-20 minutes Saturday and Sunday reviewing your flashcards, practicing counting, and
              working on your journal entry. Your brain will thank you!

PROS of Using Alexa Videos:
✓ Free and always accessible

CONS to Consider:
- Videos in English (not full immersion)

- Alexa as the "homework tutor"

=================================================
WEEKLY TIME COMMITMENT
=================================================

Average per week: 30-45 minutes of video watching
+ 15-20 minutes for video reflection/notes
= ~1 hour video-related homework

This fits within our 1-hour daily homework expectation:
- 3-4 days: Textbook exercises (20-30 min/day)
- 1 day: Journal writing (30 min)
- 1-2 days: Video watching (30-45 min total)
- Daily: Vocabulary review (10 min)

Total: ~7-10 hours/week homework (reasonable for 80-hour course)

=================================================
STUDENT RESOURCE GUIDE
=================================================

=================================================
ASSESSMENT INTEGRATION
=================================================

Weekly Quiz (Friday):
- Include 1-2 questions based on Alexa's videos
- E.g., "According to the video, what are the 3 ways to ask questions in French?"
- Ensures accountability

Midterm Exam:
- Content from videos fair game
- Tests integration of learning from multiple sources

Final Exam:
- Same approach
- Tests comprehensive understanding

Oral Assessments:
- Pronunciation techniques from videos expected
- Can reference video concepts in speaking

=================================================
SUCCESS METRICS
=================================================

Track effectiveness:
- Do students who watch videos score better on quizzes?
- Correlation between video watching and oral assessment scores?
- Student feedback on video usefulness (mid-semester survey)

Adjust as needed:
- If students not watching: add more accountability
- If too much: reduce to 1 video/week
- If too easy: add French-only videos

=================================================
ALTERNATIVE: IF VIDEOS DON'T WORK
=================================================

Backup Plan:
- Make videos optional (extra credit)
- Focus on textbook + in-class instruction
- Use videos only for struggling students
- Recommend but don't require

Our course can succeed with or without videos, but they ADD VALUE
for motivated students and different learning styles.
